Please edit config.example.json for your bot.

And rename it as config.json

Then install package. However, if you have not yet installed pnpm, it will be an error.

So, please install it with the below command:

npm -g install pnpm
```

Then just type this:

```
pnpm install
```

When that's done, please type

```
node slash.js
```

And type

```

to start the bot!
